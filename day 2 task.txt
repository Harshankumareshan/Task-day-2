1.write a blog on the difference between document and window object


 JavaScript plays a pivotal role in manipulating and controlling the behavior of web pages. When delving into the intricacies of JavaScript,
 developers often encounter two fundamental objects: the document and window objects.While they are both crucial components in web development,
 understanding their differences is essential for leveraging their functionalities effectively.

The Window Object :

The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
 It serves as the global object in client-side JavaScript and provides access to various browser functionalities and properties.

Key Features of the Window Object:

1.Global Scope: All JavaScript code running in a browser operates within the context of the window object.
 Variables and functions declared without the var, let, or const keywords become properties of the window object by default.

2.Browser Interaction: The window object allows interaction with the browser, enabling actions such as opening or closing tabs, controlling navigation history, and setting timeouts or intervals.

3.Access to Frames and IFrames: It facilitates access to frames and iframes within the browser window through properties like window.frames or window.parent.

4.Dimensions and Position: Properties like window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight, window.pageXOffset, and window.
pageYOffset provide information about the browser's dimensions and scroll positions.

 Window object −

  Top of the hierarchy.
  It is the outmost element of the object hierarchy
  examples-
  window.open() - open a new window
  window.close() - close the current window
  window.moveTo() - move the current window
  window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

The Document Object:

On the other hand, the document object is a part of the window object and represents the HTML content of the web page. It provides access to the DOM (Document Object Model) elements,
allowing manipulation and modification of the page's structure and content.


Key Features of the Document Object:

1.DOM Manipulation: The document object allows developers to access and modify elements on the web page.
 It provides methods like getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), and querySelector() to interact with specific elements.

2.Content Modification: Developers can dynamically alter the content, attributes, and styles of HTML elements using the document object.
 Elements can be created, removed, or updated using functions like createElement(), appendChild(), and setAttribute().

3.Event Handling: It enables the attachment of event listeners to various DOM elements, allowing JavaScript code to respond to user interactions or specific events triggered on the web page.

4.Forms and Input Handling: The document object facilitates access to form elements and their values, enabling validation, submission, or manipulation of form data.

Document object − 

  Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. 
  The document contains the contents of the page.
  Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page. 
  Using document object, JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page
  examples-
  document.createElement(element)	Create an HTML element
  document.removeChild(element)	Remove an HTML element
  document.appendChild(element)	Add an HTML element
  document.replaceChild(new, old)	Replace an HTML element
  document.write(text)	Write into the HTML output stream
